  ## Meetings

  Meetings are held at 19:00, every last Thursday of the month, at the [Electron Club][].  Check out our past meetings, whatâ€™s on this month, and what might be coming up on our [meetings][] page.

  ## Media

  ScotLUG usually uses the [Scottish Tux][] to refer to itself.

  ## Communication

  Our IRC channel, [#scotlug][], is usually busy and helpful.  There is a [mailing list][] for general announcements.

  ## Other Linux User Groups

  In addition to Glasgow, [Falkirk][] and [Edinburgh][] both have active Linux User Groups.  The [UK Linux User Groups organisation][UKLUG] has a list of other [user groups across Scotland][Scottish LUGs].
